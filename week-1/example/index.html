            I choose the image of space to describe my level of creativity, because for me space is incredible on 
            how everything is different. I feel this image best discribes my creativity because it depends on how 
            I am feeling or with the group of persons that Im. Also because creativity depends on the small details
            that you see, and in this image you can see a lot stars, just like when Im thinking of something I try 
            to see many details and get more.  </p>

    <p class = "paragraph"> During this week I learned what self-aware is, being self-aware is knowing that based on your actions good things may happend or 
        bad thing will happend. Self aware now for me is importart parf of being a leader because you can't be honest if you don't have self aware, 
        know I think more of my actions that I made and how I manage my time during the week to get more things. I also learned that you need to give details about story that you tell. 
        I learned that I need to be honest and don't lie to my peers.
